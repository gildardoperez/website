##### Metadata

Traditionally, instant messaging needs a server between you and and the people you talk to. That server is responsible for remembering your contacts, telling you when they're online, and forwarding your messages.

The server learns a lot about you - *who you are, who you talk to, when you're online*. We call this metadata. Without end-to-end encryption, it can also read content - *everything you say, and everything said to you*.

##### Anonymity


##### End-to-end
